## Instructions for pushing to GitHub (keerthika-art account)

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Log out of your current GitHub account (keerthana-dataanalytics)
   - Log in with the keerthika-art account
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: Age-and-Gender-Detection
   - Description: A Python project for gender and age detection using OpenCV and deep learning
   - Choose "Public" visibility
   - Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these files)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. After creating the repository, you'll see instructions. Follow these commands in your terminal:

```
# First, remove the existing remote
git remote remove origin

# Add the new remote pointing to keerthika-art's repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/keerthika-art/Age-and-Gender-Detection.git

# Push your code to the new repository
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

3. Verify that your code has been pushed to the new repository by visiting:
   https://github.com/keerthika-art/Age-and-Gender-Detection

Note: This will completely transfer your project to the keerthika-art account. The project will no longer be associated with the keerthana-dataanalytics account unless you specifically want to keep it in both places.
